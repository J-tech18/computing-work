A teenage boy and teenage girl met online through a dating app.
At this day and age, the advancements of technology has resulted in more and more dating apps being developed. 
Will their relationship succeed or end up in despair?
Are things going to become complicated between them?
Or not?

Many people think that dating apps are rip offs. Johny, for one, strongly disagrees.
In school, his poor looks and pathetic features make him look like a clown in front of the popular girls.
Additionally, he is also a clumsy pig and tends to make a fool of himself in front of them.

Oh, how much does poor little Johny wish that his could become just slightly more attractive. 
But then one day, his wishes came true, a ground-breaking app was released--Dateme!
However when Johny first discovered this new app, he was instantly hooked. Without sparing a thought, photoshopped-images of his body flashed across his childish mind.
He begun thinking about all the possibilities that could happen with the new dating app. He may just get a girlfriend after all!
With that in his mind, he installed this dating app and racked his brains to create what he considered an attractive dating profile, spending countless hours cooped up in his room living in his little bubble of imagination.
After what seemed like eternity, Johny was satisfied with his work of art.
Examining his ripped body on the screen, his eyes beamed with bliss as he grinned from ear to ear.certain that one of the girls would agree to date him.

Not long after he uploaded his profile, he already managed to secure a date. 
To his delight, the girl that liked his profile was one of the cool girls from school.
She probably could not recognise Johny as his profile name was actually George. After all, if he was going to catfish, he should catfish till the end.

For a few days, Johny chatted with the girl enthusiastically online, while slowing gathering courage to organise a physical date with her.
To his surprise, they had many common topics to talk about and Johny found himself enjoying the girl's company. Soon, Johny took his chances and proposed a date with the girl.
Johny was exhilatrated but also nervous as he feared that the girl would be disgusted if she were to find out who George was.

As expected and to Johny's utmost despair, the girl turned pale at the sight of him and immediately fled the scene.
Being a hopeless romantic, in Johny's point of view, his first love had abandoned him. 
Yet as he was determined that every love story would have a happy ending, he wrote a song to serenade the girl, giving her multiple gifts on a daily basis.
Sadly, the girl still did not accept Johny's heart. Poor Johny, looks like he has it hard.
Feeling hopeless, Johny gave up chasing her. Moreover, she had her sights on someone else. What could he even do to mend their broken relationship?

As graduation came round the corner, reality struck Johny as he realised that they would not be able to go to the same university.
Finally realising the depths of his love, he was desperate to keep the girl in his sights. 
He got out an engagement ring to confess his love for the girl. The girl, feeling revolted by Johnny's looks, did not spare him a second thought.

In the end, Johny could only leave the one who he felt was his soulmate. What romance books, Disney had fooled everyone.
Not all story has a happy ending.
This is a not a complicated love story, how could one consider a one-sided love a successful love?
